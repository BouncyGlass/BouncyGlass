              Corpse Bride is a 2005 British-American stop-motion-animated musical fantasy film directed by Mike Johnson and 
              Tim Burton, based on characters created by Burton and Carlos Grangel. The plot is set in a fictional Victorian era 
              village in Europe. Emily is the titular deuteragonist, a reanimated corpse who was a talented and wealthy lady in 
              her lifetime and the self-proclaimed bride of the young Victor Van Dort after their encounter in the woods. Emily 
              was murdered by her ex-fiancé Lord Barkis Bittern and indirectly killed him shortly before gaining her freedom, 
              therefore finally being allowed to enter Heaven. The film is inspired by an Ashkenazi ghost story with tragic 
              connections to real-world events. The original story is based on a story of a living person accidentally marrying 
              the specter of a murdered bride-to-be.

              "Edward Scissorhands" is a 1990 American fantasy gothic romance film directed by Tim Burton, starring Johnny Depp, 
              Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price, and Alan Arkin. It tells the story of 
              Edward, an artificial humanoid with scissors for hands, who is taken in by a suburban family. The film is a 
              convincingly detailed left-of-center fairytale romance that abandons the slight characterizations and special 
              effects-driven spectacle of "Batman" and serves up a convincingly detailed left-of-center fairytale romance. The 
              film was shot with the typical Burton energy and precision, and two particular sequences that are visually memorable 
              are Edward's B&E and his ice sculpture scene when Kim dances under the ice flakes.
