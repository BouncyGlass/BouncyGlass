Dear Sophi,

  This is a letter from your boyfriend and hopefully future husband, by the way I also wrote you a letter on Minecraft.
  I love you very very much and I hope this website and many of the other things I do for you, like trying to set up a server, make you happy.
  Let's have fun watching movies together even after were done with the Halloween ones. I don't know if I'll make a website like this again.
  I'll try to learn more coding to make a better one but I'll still keep this one to look back at it.
  When I get a job I'll do a lot of projects and show you them and make lots of stuff for you.
  I hope you like the heart I drew and this letter, I know its not a lot but I still hope it's good.

  Your Lover,
  Erick
